goal - install ubuntu os which can co-exist with win8 in my pc environment.

I know how to do it in virtual-box, but that does not fully use the GPU I have for my pc.
If I can install a physical ubuntu, maybe it can use GPU in ubuntu env.

1.Allocate a free disk
   control panel -> system and security -> administrative tools -> computer management
or right click my computer and select "Manage"
Storage -> disk management

2.Burn a Ubuntu ios image file to a dvd

3.When restart the machine, push "F12" to show up boot menu (so that you can make boot start from cd/dvd).

4.When create/manage the disk for ubuntu, make sure - the disk of size/space for biosgrub >= 1M (I gave 10M).
Also "Device for boot loader installation" is "/dev/sda".
Otherwise, you might run into the following failure during the installation phase.
"Executing 'grub-install /dv/sda10' failed."

5.After the installation, by default it will automatically go to Ubuntu OS, and log in.
To go to win8, you need to keep pushing "F12" when the computer starts.
From that boot menu, select windows entry.
