Quick note about my cpp env setup

I am playing with this project, OGC: Ordinary Garbage Collector (https://github.com/jserv/ogc)

1.Cygwin x64 installed on windows
gcc -v
gcc version 5.3.0 (GCC)

gdb -v
GNU gdb (GDB) (Cygwin 7.10.1-1) 7.10.1

2.Cygwin/bin is added into the sys env, Path

3.Eclipse CPP
eclipse-cpp-photon-R-win32-x86_64.zip
Debug Configurations -> Debugger -> GDB debugger: X:\cygwin64\bin\gdb.exe
