Recently, I developped some tools related to StrId.
The motivation behind is - given two big text files which contains 300k Ids, find the difference of those Ids.
The first step is Id Sorting, then check the Id diff (by using two pointers pointing to each of the Id sets).
Now I might get the clue how Set and its set_difference() implementation.
Why Set's internal data structure is (Red-Black) tree, and why its elements are sorted.

Here I am implementing the sorting by using tree, I am doing a simple way, which is external sorting.
After I finished it, I found it is slow. Then I found a good implementation in java from github, externalsortinginjava, which runs faster.
